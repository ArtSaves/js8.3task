			<p>A jednak dzia≈Ça :) </p>
			<p>What will you tell your children when they ask you "what went wrong"<br>
				How can you paint a picture of a paradise lost<br>
				To eyes that know only a wasteland<br>
				How will you justify watching the world die<br>
				<br><br>
				The clock is ticking, can't you feel our days are numbered<br>
				Head first into disaster from which there will be no return<br>
				With narrow minds we decimate our one true home<br>
				Cast into oblivion, judgment is calling<br>
				<br><br>
				Behold the pale horse<br>
				This is the funeral of the Earth<br>
				Behold the pale horse<br>
				This is the funeral<br>
				<br><br>
				The blind eye can no longer be cast<br>
				The clock is ticking, there is no second chance<br>
				<br><br>
				The blind eye can no longer be cast<br>
				There will be no future, if we can't learn from our mistakes<br>
				The clock is ticking, there is no second chance<br>
				There will be no future, if we can't learn<br>
				<br><br>
				A forced extinction closes out the age of apathy<br>
				The final act, sacrifice the world's ecology<br>
				The death of beauty, the death of hope<br>
				Cast before the throne of avarice, judgment is calling<br>
				<br><br>
				Behold the pale horse<br>
				This is the funeral of the Earth<br>
				Behold the pale horse<br>
				This is the funeral<br> 
				<br><br>
				The blind eye can no longer be cast<br>
				There will be no future, if we can't learn from our mistakes<br>
				The clock is ticking, there is no second chance<br>
				There will be no future, if we can't learn<br>
				<br><br>
				I can't watch it burn<br>
				<br><br>
				Behold the pale horse!</p>
